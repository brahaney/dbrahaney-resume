				Senior QA Engineer
			</span>

			<span class="startDate">
				May 2022

			<span class="endDate">
				- Present
			</span>

			<ul class="highlights">
				<li>Wrote new test automation framework in python, using pytest, for statistical model APIs created by our data science team</li>
				<li>Wrote a test automation framework for validating intermittently-unreliable live data feeds, processing millions of events per day and visualizing error rates and other results in Kibana, and alerting the team if thresholds for incomplete/unusable events are reached. Allowing for simple addition of validation cases whenever engineering discovers a potential issue.</li>
				<li>Worked with developers to build load/performance testing with locust, testing API endpoints deployed to kubernetes while capturing kubernetes resource utilization data for the pods under test</li>
				<li>Deployed data validation framework using Serverless Framework as AWS lambda triggered by SNS/SQS</li>
				<li>Due to certain data sources not on AWS, re-worked data validation framework to also be deployable direct to kubernetes</li>
				<li>Worked with data scientists and software engineers across two teams to improve unit testing, data validation and test automation</li>
				<li>Worked closely with Product Manager on new feature specifications, ensuring that the specifications are clear enough to avoid misunderstandings and ensure the best quality work from our engineering teams.</li>
				<li>Worked closely with UX designers on design specs, ensuring usability and making sure the designs provided were able to be implemented. Reducing back-and-forth time between UX and developers prior to/during implementation</li>
				<li>Logged defects, verified fixes</li>
				<li>Aided in PR reviews and unit test case development</li>
				<li>Implemented snyk and SonarCloud into CI/CD pipeline for additional quality/security feedback for teams</li>
				<li>Regularly reviewed snyk/sonar results with team, logging Jira cards for issues worth fixing</li>

			<ul class="highlights">
				<li>Performed manual and automated testing on RedHat OpenShift&#x27;s internal software-defined networking modules. Primarily worked with ovn-kubernetes.</li>
				<li>built, managed and troubleshot OpenShift (kubernetes) clusters for testing and development</li>
				<li>Logged defects, and verified defect fixes prior to release</li>
				<li>Performed regression testing after security/bug fixes were backported to older supported OpenShift versions</li>
				<li>Performed new test-case reviews for team mates, PR reviews for automation code commits</li>
				<li>Lead a small breakout team to rework automated testing CI pipeline to require less manual intervention. Previously, test results for dozens or more test runs per day needed to be manually reviewed, informing QA teams of failures that need to be investigated. We developed a chatbot that could alert necessary teams in Slack based on testcase ownership and a database of known errors, leaving only a small portion of &quot;unknown&quot; errors up to manual intervention, freeing up at least 30 hours a week of engineering time from this continuous task.</li>

				<li>Created and maintained Postman collections for all API endpoints</li>
				<li>Integrated Postman collections into test framework</li>
				<li>Developed a new test framework &quot;supersoaker&quot; for &quot;soak&quot; testing. These tests ran for many days at a time, simulating to some degree basic customer use cases and regression-testing against various race conditions and over-consuming processing resource issues that had previously been discovered</li>
				<li>Deployed &quot;supersoaker&quot; to kubernetes clusters for long-running tests</li>
