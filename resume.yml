  summary: Dedicated and hardworking professional who is passionate about DevOps,
    test automation and cloud software development. Ready to take on any challenge,
    and excited to contribute to new technology and grow as a part of a great team.
    In my work on test automation, I have become fascinated with all aspects of engineering
    best practices, including CI/CD, testing, change management, and site reliability
    engineering. I would welcome the opportunity to dive into any of these areas of
    expertise.

  position: Senior QA Engineer
  startDate: '2022-05-31'
  endDate: ''
  highlights:
    - Wrote new test automation framework in python, using pytest, for statistical model APIs created by our data science team
    - Wrote a test automation framework for validating intermittently-unreliable live data feeds, processing millions of events per day and visualizing error rates and other results in Kibana, and alerting the team if thresholds for incomplete/unusable events are reached. Allowing for simple addition of validation cases whenever engineering discovers a potential issue.
    - Worked with data scientists and software engineers across two teams to improve unit testing, data validation and test automation
    - Worked closely with Product Manager on new feature specifications, ensuring that the specifications are clear enough to avoid misunderstandings and ensure the best quality work from our engineering teams.
    - Worked closely with UX designers on design specs, ensuring usability and making sure the designs provided were able to be implemented. Reducing back-and-forth time between UX and developers prior to/during implementation
    - Logged defects, verified fixes
    - Aided in PR reviews and unit test case development
    - Implemented snyk and SonarCloud into CI/CD pipeline for additional quality/security feedback for teams
    - Regularly reviewed snyk/sonar results with team, logging Jira cards for issues worth fixing

  location: remote
  position: Senior Software QE Engineer
  startDate: '2020-09-30'
  endDate: '2022-05-31'
  highlights:
    - Performed manual and automated testing on RedHat OpenShift's internal software-defined networking modules. Primarily worked with ovn-kubernetes.
    - Logged defects, and verified defect fixes prior to release
    - Performed regression testing after security/bug fixes were backported to older supported OpenShift versions
    - Performed new test-case reviews for team mates, PR reviews for automation code commits
    - Lead a small breakout team to rework automated testing CI pipeline to require less manual intervention. Previously, test results for dozens or more test runs per day needed to be manually reviewed, informing QA teams of failures that need to be investigated. We developed a chatbot that could alert necessary teams in Slack based on testcase ownership and a database of known errors, leaving only a small portion of "unknown" errors up to manual intervention, freeing up at least 30 hours a week of engineering time from this continuous task.

    - Wrote playbooks and documentation, in conjunction with new trestle tooling, to help customer support solve more issues without escalating their cases to our team.
    - Wrote test automation for production monitoring, to give higher visibility into commonly occurring issues in order to address them before customer support escalations.
